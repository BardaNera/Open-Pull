Version 1:
Carrier PCB for:
	- Arduino Nano,
	- Sparkfun HX711 Weight Cell Amplifier
	- 2x Polulu Stepper Motor Driver
	- 2x 100uF smoothing Capacitor for Stepper Motor Drivers either SMD or THT
	- a on board sync-led either THT or SMD
	- IMPORTANT NOTICE: this is the 1st version of the board and may still contain errors!!! 
	  ALSO: only use either an SMD or a THT capacitor same goes for the onboard LED.
	
Parts:
	- Arduino Nano: original or clone will do
	- Sparkfun HX711: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879
	- Polulu A4988 Stepper Motor Drivers: https://www.pololu.com/product/1182
	- R1/R2: 330 Ohm Resistor: 1/4W THT or 0805 SMD
	- LED1/LED2: 3.5mm LED or 0805 LED color doesn't matter (ajust resistor for blue)
	- C1/C3 & C2/C4: Any fitting Capcitor will do, I designed around these:
			- THT: WURTH ELECTRONIC 860020674015
			- SMD: WURTH ELECTRONIC 865060653010
	- CELL-0, 1, 2, X1: WURTH ELECTRONIC 691214110002
	- CON1, CON2, CON3: Any 100mil/1.27mm pitch connector that fits your needs. You can als solder directly into the holes.
